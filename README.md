# Flask REST API Challenge

This repository stores the code for the coding challenge prompted by Maxar. The current repository stores the necessary files to get started and run a basic REST API Development of Flask. 

## Prompt

Backend API Developer - Code Challenge

Problem:
Create a REST API, with a single resource, that accepts an HTTP POST method request with two GeoJSON polygon objects.
This should returns a Boolean value indicating whether the provided objects spatially intersect one another.

Requirements:
• All requests and responses must be valid JSON
• The completed challenge must be pushed to GitHub (github.com) or .zip for review
• Include relevant documentation for the running and testing of the application.
Note:
• Try and write the application in Python if possible and use open source libraries to your advantage!
• It’s ok if you are unable to complete the challenge, but at minimum be prepared to discuss possible implementation steps during onsite interview.

Guidance:
• This should take less than 4 hrs to complete (although, you can take up to a week to send back your solution)
• We're not looking for perfection, but rather a framework to hold a discussion about your thoughts on design, implementation, library selection, etc...
• If you're taking more time than expected: add skeleton code, comments, etc... to support that discussion.

## Prerequisites
Python >= 3.6
virtualenv >= v16.7.7
pip >= 19.2.3

## Step-up

To install all the required dependencies to run Flask and the API, you will need to run the following command to import all the required libraries:

 ```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
